## ABOUT

![](line.gif)

**AxisBot** - snipe and sell SPL tokens at lightning speed. Our sniping bot helps you maintain a higher level of security while also giving you the fastest sniping speed possible. Built by Traders for Traders.

Observing market trends, we noticed a rising interest in token sniping, initially on ETH and gradually shifting to SOL. In silence, over the past few months, we've been developing a SOL Token Sniper.

## V1.0 Features

![](line.gif)

Below are the main features of our bot and recommendations on how to use them. 
More incredible features are currently in the works to take your experience to the next level.

1. `Dedicated RPC` - dedicated RPC that provides blazing speed to your transactions, you can also easily replace it with your RPC.
2. `Jito Tip` - possibility to increase the priority of your transaction, we recommend choosing from 0.01 SOL to 0.1 SOL depending on the network load and the hype around the project, so that the purchase can be made within 1-2 seconds.
3. `Frontrun/AntiMev` - helps you get rid of annoying bots and not waste your money.
4. `TP/SL/Trailing/Timer` - several types of closing your position depending on the profit made, time passed since the purchase, etc.
5. `Custom Slippage` - is the difference between the crypto actual price and the price you desire to trade, for normal sniping we recommend to put 100-200, for sniping of hype projects 1000-2000.
6. `WSOL/USDC` - depending on the pair, sniping with WSOL helps to significantly reduce your transaction time.
7. `Spam Snipe` - allows you to send hundreds and thousands of spam transactions, where only one will go through at the moment of trading start, but it will provide the fastest purchase possible, we advise you to know the approximate time of adding liquidity, because each transaction costs some amount of SOL.
8. `Burn/Lock/Renounce/Rug Score Check` - bot will buy only those tokens that fit your chosen criteria, which will significantly increase the chance of a successful trade.
